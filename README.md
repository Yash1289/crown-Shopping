# Crown E-Commerce Website

E-commerce or electronic commerce refers to a business model involving sales transactions on the web. An e-commerce website is any site that allows you to buy and sell products and services online. An e-commerce website can help a brand grab more eyeballs without worrying about budget problems. It also allows to keep the shop open for the customers 24/7 & serve them with quality products throughout the year. In this project, I have built an e-commerce website using react and redux with sign-in, sign-up and checkout functionalities that can be installed as a progressive mobile app as well.
